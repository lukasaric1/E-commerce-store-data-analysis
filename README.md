I made a segmentation by gender, that is, I compared the number of men and women of the total number of customers. I also made a segmentation of costs by customer age, i.e. I compared how much was spent by customers over 35 and how much was spent by customers 35 years or younger. We also compared in the total percentage of consumption how much of the total earned money was brought to us by male and how much by female customers

# CONCLUSION

From the analysis of this data based on a sample of 1000 customers, we can draw the following conclusions: 
* We have more male than female customers.
* Men spent more money than women if we look at the total number of men and women. We would get more precise information if we compared the same number of women and men.
* People over the age of 35 brought us more money than those who are 35 or younger.

Also we could do:
* Forecasting seasonal sales trends
* Visualization of the sales performance of a specific product or product category
