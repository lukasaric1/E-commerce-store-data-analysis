# E-commerce-store-data-analysis
In this project, a sample of 1000 customers of a random online store was taken. The table contains the following data:
*customer_id
*transaction_id
*transaction_date
*product_id
*product_name
*category
*quantity
*price_usd
*total_price_usd
*customer_age
*customer_gender
*customer_city

I made a segmentation by gender, that is, I compared the number of men and women of the total number of customers. I also made a segmentation of costs by customer age, i.e. I compared how much was spent by customers over 35 and how much was spent by customers 35 years or younger. We also compared in the total percentage of consumption how much of the total earned money was brought to us by male and how much by female customers
